## **General FAQ**

??? question "Pairing Multiple Remotes "
    **Q**: I purchased a kit (like the KR1201A) with two remotes, but it seems to only pair with one remote at a time. When I pair the second remote, the first one stops working. What is the correct procedure to pair both remotes?

    **A**: When you match the second remote, you don't need to press the button on the receiver 8 times again to reset it.

??? question "Mode Retention After Power Loss"
    **Q**: If I've paired my transmitter and receiver and set a specific working mode, will the receiver remember this mode if it loses power?

    **A**: Yes, generally, once a QIACHIP receiver and transmitter are paired and a working mode (e.g., momentary, toggle, latched) is set, the receiver will retain these settings. This means that even if the receiver is powered off and then powered back on, it should remember the last configured working mode and its paired transmitters.

??? question "Compatibility with Other Brands"
    **Q**: Can I use remote controls or receivers from other brands with QIACHIP products?

    **A**: For reliable operation and to ensure all features and working modes function as intended, it is strongly recommended to use QIACHIP brand remote controls (transmitters) with QIACHIP controllers (receivers/wireless remote control switches). While some third-party remotes or receivers might seem to work, compatibility is not guaranteed, and you may experience issues with pairing, range, or functionality of specific modes.

??? question "1. üîå Wiring Method"
    **Q**: How did you wire this?

    **A**: I'm glad you asked. Since many people have the same question, I made a detailed video using motor control to demonstrate the working principle.

    If you still have doubts, feel free to ask. I hope it helps!

??? question "2. üîã Power Loss and Reprogramming"
    **Q**: Thanks for the video. I'm wondering, if the electronic board loses power, do I need to reprogram the remote control, or will it work with the last programming?

    **A**: Usually, these devices keep their code and paired remotes even after a power cut. However, a concern is that they may default to the "on" state. If power is restored, it could turn on your heater and pose a fire risk. Also, for remotes with rolling codes, if the battery dies, you'll need to reprogram. The remote starts with a zero code, while the receiver expects a higher rolled - code, causing a mismatch until re - learning. Each battery change requires re - learning the remote!

??? question "3. üì° Frequency Adjustment"
    **Q**: Hi! I've got the KR2402 working with DC 6 - 30V, but I'm having frequency issues. Can I change the frequency, and how? Thanks.

    **A**: What kind of problems are you facing? If the frequency of the KR2402 changes, the paired remote control (transmitter) must also change its frequency.

??? question "4. üì± Multiple Remote Pairing"
    **Q**: In momentary mode, can I program multiple transmitters to channels A & B, or is it one transmitter per channel?

    **A**: You can pair multiple transmitters with the receiver. Note: When adding multiple remotes, you don't need to press the receiver's button 8 times before each pairing. Pressing it 8 times resets the receiver and clears all paired remotes.

??? question "5. ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Control"
    **Q**: How can the remote (transmitter) work automatically, like for automatic on/off of a submersible pump motor?

    **A**: I'm glad you asked. As many have the same question, I made a video demonstrating the principle using motor control.

??? question "6. üí° LED Light Control"
    **Q**: Can it be used with DC to turn on an LED light indoors when it's dark?

    **A**: Yes, if you use the 12V kit.

??? question "7. üîÑ Application Scenarios"
    **Q**: Is it only for LEDs? For pump motor switching, are there design changes needed? Any commercial plans?

    **A**: It's not limited to LEDs. LED control is just a demonstration. You can apply it to other devices.

??? question "8. üéÆ Simultaneous Key Press"
    **Q**: What happens if I press both keys simultaneously in momentary mode? Will only one work, or will both LEDs light up? I need only one channel active at a time to protect the engine.

    **A**: If you press both buttons on the remote at the same time, the receiver won't activate, and neither channel will have an output.

??? question "9. üîÄ Mixed Mode"
    **Q**: Can I use a single remote to control one switch in momentary mode and another in toggle mode?

    **A**: I'm glad you brought this up. Let me confirm: You have two switches and one remote, and you want to control them in different modes, right? In theory, it's possible, but not recommended. Unless the switches are far apart, the remote's signal may interfere with both when activating one. Using two remotes is a better option to avoid interference. I hope this clears your doubt. Share your feedback later!

??? question "10. üîÑ Reset Settings"
    **Q**: Do I need to reset the remote control repeatedly, or will it work with a one - time setup?
